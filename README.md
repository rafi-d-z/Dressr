# Executive Summary:
Dressr is a revolutionary web application that simplifies the process of selecting outfits by generating outfit recommendations based on the user's local weather and their existing wardrobe items. The motivation behind Dressr is to streamline the daily routine of individuals who want to start their day with a stylish and weather-appropriate outfit without the hassle of checking the weather forecast and rummaging through their closet. Dressr primarily targets fashion-forward individuals, wardrobe enthusiasts, and anyone seeking a more efficient and stress-free approach to dressing. While similar applications exist, Dressr sets itself apart by combining weather data with a user's wardrobe, ensuring that every outfit recommendation is tailored to the current weather conditions. By leveraging a weather API to continuously update weather data, Dressr provides users with up-to-date outfit suggestions no matter where they are.
